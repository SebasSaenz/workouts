# A YEAR OF DATA

I wear an Apple smart watch almost every day and I am using the collected data
to summaries how active I am. I plotted the summary of 2022 and I would monthly update the
2023 plot.

If you want to replicate this figure with your own data, you would have to download the files from the Apple health app. You can follow this [tutorial](https://medium.com/macoclock/how-to-export-health-data-from-iphone-60a88cfe1825). Unzio the data and place it in the **rawdata** folder.
